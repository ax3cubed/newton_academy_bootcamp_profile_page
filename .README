## Portfolio Section Explanation

The portfolio section is designed using **Flexbox** to create a responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes. Here's a breakdown of how the section works:

- **HTML Structure**: The portfolio items are wrapped inside a `div` container with the class `portfolio-container`. Each project is represented by a `div` with the class `portfolio-item`.
- **Flexbox Layout**:
    - The `.portfolio-container` is set to `display: grid` with `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit,minmax(200px, 1fr));` to allow the items to wrap onto the next line if necessary.
    - Each `.portfolio-item` uses `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit,minmax(200px, 1fr));` to ensure it takes up approximately one-third of the container's width, minus spacing.
- **Responsive Adjustments**:
    - On screens smaller than 768px, the items adjust to `calc(50% - 2rem)` to stack two items per row.
    - On screens smaller than 480px, the items take up the full width of the container.

## Responsive Design

The portfolio section is designed to be fully responsive:

- **Media Queries**: Used to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
    - **768px and below**: Items stack two per row.
    - **480px and below**: Items stack one per row, taking up the full width of the screen.

This ensures the portfolio looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Enhancements

Here are some potential enhancements you could implement:

- **Lightbox Effect**: Clicking on a portfolio image could open a larger view in a modal window.
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for images to improve performance.
- **Animations**: Add CSS animations for hover effects or when portfolio items load.
